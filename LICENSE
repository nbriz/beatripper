"[...] it’s okay to copy! Believe in the process of copying as much as you can; with all your heart is a good place to start – get into it as straight and honestly as possible. Copying is as good (I think better from this vector-view) as any other way of getting ‚’there.’ [...]" 
—Phil Morton [COPY<IT>RIGHT]

[TERMS + AGREEMENT + PHILOSOPHIES]

    i hereby agree that [conventional] notions of originality are myths + that the cultural products i produce [both in content && concept] are [re]combinations of [pre]existing ideas + that any feelings i may have to the contrary are simply cases of cryptomnesia + that i recognize any future work i produce to be undiscovered public knowledge.

    i understand [historically] that the laws of what we now call intellectual property have been developed by institutions of power who have sought to maintain control over information && culture to further their own agendas + that the invention && development of these laws have had little to do with what we [traditionally] call authorship

    economically, i understand my ideas [+any digital manifestation they may take] to be a non-rivalrous good—that is to say, that additional units can be infinitely copied/shared at no cost && that any [re]use can not prevent any prior/existing use—and as such should be shared freely for the moral and mutual instruction of all people + that any restrictions on [re]use would impose inefficient && unnatural scarcity.

    piracy is a refusal to comply with an established forced scarcity agenda. piracy is a compositional prerogative. piracy is-not plagiarism nor is it imposterism + attribution is key to this distinction—not in the interest of maintaining [conventional] notions of authorship—in the interest of deep linkage && participatory culture[s].

    i hereby forfeit any intellectual property—imposed on me by any copyright regimes—on any cultural products I may render from the use of this artware + if i choose to share my cultural products i will do so without any restrictions on its [re]use.
