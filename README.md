# BeatR¡pper

BeatR¡pper is critical artware [softwaer+art] + music tool for piratical practices, specifically: extracting the "rythmic DNA" of a song + using it as a blueprint for new tracks. BeatR¡pper is distributed under the copy&lt;it&gt;right license (along side the GNU GPL v3.0 ), politically aligned copying/sharing is encouraged/appreciated.

BeatR¡pper is also a demo of the [liBB](https://github.com/brangerbriz/BBMod.js) project by [Branger_Briz](http://www.brangerbriz.com/)
